            <p class="mt-6 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-700">
              EOC.online is more of a goal and vision for a possible community
              of Emergency Managers (EMs) than any single technological
              solution. Frustrated by poor communications and inadequate current
              technological solutions, the hope is to provide some insights that
              can help inform & grow the technological knowledge-base of
              Emergency Managers and especially those working in that role *in
              addition* to their many other roles in rural and understaffed
              Emergency Operation Centers (EOCs).

              Open Source software has been a trend for more than the past
              decade, but has not made it far in the Emergency Management field.
              Hopefully we can change that!

                <li>
                  o An ongoing series of blogs exploring technological ideas

                <li>
                  o Simple open-source software solutions and demonstrations
                  that may be of use to Emergency Managers and volunteer

                </li>
                <li>
                  o Website templates and components for EOC websites: whether
                  the audience might be internal staff, trusted volunteer
                  organizations or the general public. The roadmap is unwritten,
                  but will be determined by your ideas and inspiration.

                  RangerTrak is a simple web application that allows you to track
                  the location of your rangers in real time. It is designed to be
                  used by a single person, but can be used by multiple people at
                  the same time. It is a great tool for tracking the location of
                  your rangers in real time, and can be used to help you make decisions
                  about where to send your rangers in the event of an emergency.

                  FEMA has defined skills that people working in an EOC may be required
                  by that EOC to possess. A handy way to decide what skills to require
                  for your EOC is via an EOC Skillset Crosswalk. This can be viewed
                  as a Google Sheet or Office Excel spreadsheet.
